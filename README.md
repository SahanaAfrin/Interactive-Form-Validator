Interactive-form-validator
This project is an interactive registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience. It includes robust real-time validation for all input fields, ensuring that users meet the required criteria before submission. The form validates the first name and last name to contain only alphabets, checks for a properly formatted email address, ensures a 10-digit phone number, and enforces strong password requirements, such as a minimum of 8 characters with at least one number and a special character. Error messages are displayed dynamically, guiding users to correct their inputs instantly. Additionally, the submit button remains disabled until all fields are valid, preventing incomplete or incorrect submissions. With its modern design, responsive layout, and clean codebase, this project serves as a practical example of implementing form validation.
